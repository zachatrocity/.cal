# .cal - Self Hosted Scheduler

This is in progress, I'll publish to a docker image when alpha is ready 

## Goals

- aggregate multiple ICS calendar feeds (URLs)
- remove event titles so we can make public
- leverage github repo as public facing UI
- sync w/ cronjob

## Setup
this is designed to be self hosted and depends on a preconfigured ssh key for authenticiation.

1. Create a new git repo to be used as your public facing calendar (i.e. `zachatrocity/cal`)

2. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` and update the envs

3. `docker-compose up -d`

## Schedule Format

The schedule is published to your GitHub repository with the following structure:

- `README.md` - current week's schedule
- `future/YYYY-WXX.md` - upcoming weekly schedules
- `past/YYYY-WXX.md` - past weekly schedule archives

The schedule shows:
- ðŸŸ¢ Available - Open slots
- ðŸ”´ Busy - Scheduled meetings (aggregated & anonymized)
- ðŸŸ¡ Tentative - Tentatively scheduled

## Development

To build and run locally:

```bash
cd backend
go mod download
go build ./cmd/server
./server
```
